                    <p class="section-left">In todays internet the overwhelming majority of IP addresses are held by computers and computer-like devices, whose function it is to make calculations, and display them to users as information terminals. I mean desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, servers, and terminals. This is often known as the Internet of Computers- most of the stuff networked together is computers.<br>
                    We are approaching the day of the Internet of Things (known by te acronym IoT). In this vision, a vast majority of the internet IP addresses will be used not by computers but by things. Not that there will be fewer computers but they will be hugely outnumbered by things.<br>
					What Things, you ask? Well, here's just a partial list of stuff that will have IP addresses and wireless connections or power line networking:<br><br>
					Light bulbs (so you can monitor power usage, life, state, and set the brightness levels and on off timers)<br>
					Your oven, your stove, your microwave<br><br>
					your refrigerator so you can check temperature and scan it for stock. It can if you wish order more staples automatically - milk, eggs etc. when low or on a regular schedule)<br><br>
					Your car - door locks and ignition now controlled by wireless proximity keys will be controlled by bluetooth and you will use the internet to program who gets to use it for what and when and see where it is and where its been and how fast its been going (watch out teen drivers).<br><br>
					Your front and rear door locks to your house so you can both see and control who enters and leaves and grant time-based one time or repeat permissions to individuals (your cleaning woman, a repairman, a babysitter, etc)<br><br>
					your air conditioning thermostat<br><br>
					your media devices - stereo and AV library<br><br>
					Your robotic vacuum cleaner<br><br>
					your watch if you still have one<br><br>
					your utility meters<br><br>
					your clothes washer and dryer<br><br>
					your water heater<br><br>
					Here's an elaborate example: the thermostat checks with an internet weather site and determines the outside-inside temperature differential.After checking with the house security system it decides there are no open doors or windows and the A/C is working too hard for the temperature so it need service. It connects to your "trusted" A/C service and makes an appointment after listing the synptoms and at the time of the appointment it programs the front gate and home service entrance lock to admit the service man based on his bluetooth identity at the appointed time. Upon verifying the AC is fixed and that none of the security points (safe, jewelry chest, AV-equipment is still connected) have been tampered with it authorized payments to the service man.<br>
					I could go on for a long time but can you begin to see the future? Some of them are already here.<br><br>
