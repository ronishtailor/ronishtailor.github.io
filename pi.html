                    <p class="section-left">Pi network is legitimate and good cryptocurrency started by the three stanford University PhDs and the good thing about this cryptocurrency is that there is no need of any graphic cards or any setup to mine this coin as in bitcoin you can easily mine this from your smart phone without draining your battery and you can close the app after clicking to mining after every 24 hr. also it is a free app you can download it from the google play store or apple app store.<br><br>
                    But the main thing is that you need a invitation code to join this pi network without this code you can't join in this network and it is compulsory and 9.5+ million users are joined this pi network already and after 10M mark the mining value will be going down per hour or it will be stopped.<br><br>
                    For now their is no value of this digital currency but in future the expected value of this coin can be very high if this project will be successful if you don't know I will tell you that the BTC price in 2009 was basically zero their is no value on that time and on 2011 the pice of bitcoin is only 1$ but after that the price of bitcoin suddenly increased 200–300$ in 2012 and in 2013–14 more than 1000$ and now the price of bitcoin is more than 17,000$ More than 12 lakhs in indian rupees It's price fluctuates really fast the highest price of this coin in 2017 was 19,783$ per coin.
					</p>
                    <p class="section-left">Pi network cryptocurrency is different from other cryptos because we can mine pi coins easily from the smartphones and it is very easy only what we have to do is just clicking on mining to start the mining after every 24 hr.
