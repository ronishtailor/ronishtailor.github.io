                    <p class="section-left">Data Science is a word that is becoming more popular these days. Though, what data science is and what type of skills one must need, etc., is important to know to pursue a career in this domain. Firstly, let me explain what data science is and its lifecycle, skills needed to be a successful data scientist, and so on.<br>
                    We are approaching the day of the Internet of Things (known by te acronym IoT). In this vision, a vast majority of the internet IP addresses will be used not by computers but by things. Not that there will be fewer computers but they will be hugely outnumbered by things.<br>
					In simple terms, data science is defined as the process of obtaining valuable insights from structured and unstructured data by using various tools and techniques. Some of the techniques practiced in data science include data extraction, data analysis, data mining, and data retrieval, to produce informative results. The person who is performing such kind of jobs is called a data scientist. Besides, it is widely used to make decisions and predictions through the use of prescriptive analytics, machine learning, and predictive causal analytics.<br><br>
					With the advent of more and more information, it is becoming harder to find the accurate form of data that is required to make business decisions. Nowadays, most of the data is unstructured and one could find a lot of junk data when they extract information. Here comes the emergence of data science.<br><br>
					These days, every organization has employed a data scientist to examine their data which was previously unused and inactive. So, every firm has realized the significance of employing a data scientist at their disposal, which has raised the demand for certified and qualified data scientists. Data Scientists are the most sought-after professionals across the world and one can earn more than other professionals.<br><br>
